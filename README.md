# Mock-Inventory
This project based on passion, trying to understand and incorporate the way in which inventory management system works within Staples. After working for Staples, I began  to see how I can create some of the systems that we use from a day to day basis.
I was asked to come into work to spectate a third-party company that would be installing new registers alongside my manager. Having numerous hours of just sitting down and doing nothing, I decided to take that time to create my own version of the inventory system that is used on a day-to-day basis at Staples. I wanted to make sure that there were no inputs that could crash the program. Inventory management is one of the biggest things when it comes to working in the retail sector. This program serves as a real-world example of a system that can be incorporated to manage inventory.
